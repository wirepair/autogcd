# Google Chrome Debugger (GCD)
This is primarly an auto-generated client library for communicating with a Google Chrome Browser over their [remote client debugger protocol](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/debugger-protocol). Note that their documentation is partially incorrect and does not contain a lot of the API calls that are actually available.

Because I'm lazy and there are hundereds of different custom types and API methods, this library has been automatically generated using their [protocol.json](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/third_party/WebKit/Source/devtools/protocol.json&q=protocol.json&sq=package:chromium&type=cs). 

The [gcdapigen](https://github.com/wirepair/gcd/tree/master/gcdapigen) program was created to generate types, event types and commands for gcd.

# Changelog 
See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/wirepair/gcd/tree/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Dependencies
gcd requires the [gcdapi](https://github.com/wirepair/gcd/tree/master/gcdapi) and [gcdmessage](https://github.com/wirepair/gcd/tree/master/gcdmessage) packages. gcdapi is the auto-generated API. gcdmessage is the glue between gcd and gcdapi so we can keep the packages clean. 

## The API
The API consists of of synchronous requests, asynchronous requests / events. Synchronous requests are handled by using non-buffered channels and methods can be called and will return once the value is available. Events are handled by subscribing the response method type and calling the API's "Enable()" such as:
```Go
    target, err := debugger.NewTab()
    if err != nil {
    	log.Fatalf("error getting new tab: %s\n", err)
	}
	console := target.Console

	target.Subscribe("Console.messageAdded", func(target *ChromeTarget, v []byte) {
		
		msg := &gcdapi.ConsoleMessageAddedEvent{}
		err := json.Unmarshal(v, msg)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("error unmarshalling event data: %v\n", err)
		}
		log.Printf("METHOD: %s\n", msg.Method)
		eventData := msg.Params.Message
		log.Printf("Got event: %s\n", eventData)
	})
	console.Enable()
	// recv events
	// console.Disable()
```
